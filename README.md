# Tilty Tokens Solver

A **Breadth-First Search (BFS) solver** for the Roblox game [Tilty Tokens](https://www.roblox.com/games/15675702).

## Overview
This tool computes the shortest sequence of moves to solve a given Tilty Tokens board.  
It uses BFS to guarantee an optimal solution when one exists.  
Although it can be used for the original **Tilt board game**, this version is labeled for **Tilty Tokens** since it can also automatically send the solution inputs.

## Features
- 🔍 **Optimal search** – finds the shortest solution path using BFS  
- 🎮 **Roblox integration** – designed specifically for the Tilty Tokens minigame  
- 🖥️ **GUI interface** – visualize the board and solution steps  
- ⌨️ **Auto key sending** – after pressing **Solve**, press **F6** to automatically send the solution keys with a delay between moves  
  - Default delay: **1.2 seconds** between moves  
  - The delay can be adjusted near the bottom of the script if your FPS or system performance requires a different timing
