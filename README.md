# Tilty Tokens Solver

A **Breadth-First Search (BFS) solver** for the Roblox game [Tilty Tokens](https://www.roblox.com/games/15675702).

## Overview
This tool computes the shortest sequence of moves to solve a given Tilty Tokens board.  
It uses BFS to guarantee an optimal solution when one exists.

## Features
- 🔍 **Optimal search** – finds the shortest solution path using BFS  
- 🎮 **Roblox integration** – designed specifically for the Tilty Tokens minigame  
- 🖥️ **GUI interface** – visualize the board and solution steps
